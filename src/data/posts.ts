“I ask God/the Universe/Angels/Guides of the Highest Truth and compassion to release any distorted, dissonant, delusional energies out of my energy field. I cut the cords between me and entities that are latching on to my energy, especially those that are not of my highest good. I come back to my own energy. And so, it is.

Weddings are happy events with lots of emotions bouncing from place to place. Person to person. Enjoy it. Tap into the loving energy field that is present. Dance. Sing. Take pictures before you get to the venue because there is usually barely any time during the wedding. Take pictures and videos with the groom/bride and all your friends. Soak in the love, and then soak your feet in ice. Or if you can, take a cold bath/ice bath to revive you.

The year is soon coming to an end & a new year is fast approaching. Now is a great moment to take the time to reflect on the lessons 2020 has brought us. Here are some of mine:

1. Do not fight to be right 
2. I am whole with or without
3. Forgiveness is my path to freedom
4. Rest is not for the wicked. It is for the wise
5. Trust the signs. There are no coincidences in life
6. Dance even through the storm, the tears, the depression, the struggle
7. I am worthy just as I am. Recognizing it is what will allow me to receive
8. I feel most in love when I surrender deeply to a God of my own understanding
9. Guilt and shame will take me nowhere. Gratitude and empowering myself will
10. Sometimes the story that wants to be written is greater than the one you want to write
11. To love yourself is to listen to your intuition. To listen to your intuition is to love yourself
12. Release the grip you have on this moment and allow the present moment to transform you
13. Don’t wait for others to accept you to accept yourself as you are. If you do you may wait forever
14. It may not be our choice what happens to us, but it’s always a choice how we respond to it
15. Allow yourself to transform and be unapologetically yourself as you are today, not yesterday
16. The idea that changing yourself into anything else takes away the opportunity to become who you are
17. Pay more attention to your soul and what makes it come alive. Pay less attention to what others think of you
18. It isn’t about you. It is about what flows through you. Your body is merely a vehicle for spirit to flow through you
19. If you wait for a future event to make you happy, you will always be seeking for something that does not exist
20. Man’s calamity is God’s opportunity. When life throws you on your knees, it is putting you in the perfect position for prayer 

I would love for you to share your lessons with me in the comments below!

We all have demons that live within our heads. Like imaginary monsters living under our beds, or hiding in our closets, these demons in our minds are also imaginary. We can either realise that if we decide to bring ourselves down, we are living in separation to source energy. When we don’t recognise our own light, we are literally vibrating against the Creator’s energy. Be willing to see yourself as the light being that you really are. Learn to be your number 1 cheerleader. Want yourself to win. Acknowledge that you have been through a whirlwind of a journey. You may have drowned a few times, or you may believe others tried to suffocate you. Either way, your soul is suffering and it is time to cultivate a flourishing garden in your mind and body.

By being your own best friend, you begin to ask yourself these important questions:
- Who am I? 
- What do I like? 
- What is important to me? 
- What do I want to do with my life? What am I good at? 

Keep going with this practice. This is a lifelong process, not an overnight recipe. You can’t expect things to change immediately so be gentle, very gentle with yourself.

3. Be honest about your own limitations
In all aspects of your life, be honest with yourself. Self-honesty is not something we are very good at doing for some reason. However only by making a sincere assessment of what is blocking you, repressing you, and holding you back, can you move beyond feeling insecure. You may wonder what does this have to do with feeling secure? Well most of the time, the things we are scared of in life are the very things we are meant to be doing.

In my case, I was terrified of speaking my truth. I was scared of speaking out loud generally. The fact that I did not use my voice kept me feeling very insecure. I could not participate in conversations the way I wanted to. I couldn’t share my thoughts in classrooms because I was afraid of what others thought of me. I did not want to be seen that I purposely played small to “safe”. Ironically, playing safe doesn’t make you feel safe. Only by working on opening up my throat chakra was I able to overcome this limitation and in turn, started to feel more secure about who I am and what I want to share.

Ask yourself and journal about these questions:
1. What are my limited beliefs?
2. What is my story? What do I feel is blocking me to fulfil my destiny?

When we were younger, we truly believed we could conquer the world but things happened and we stopped believing in ourselves. We had a few “bad” experiences and we’ve closed ourselves off from truly expressing ourselves. In the next post I’ll be sharing a few other ways to help you overcome insecurities. I hope you enjoyed reading these steps and if you have any comments, please do share them with me!

When I ask you to question what you watch, read and absorb it’s because I want you to be aware of the programing that is occurring & how it affects your current & future realities. This does not mean that all your programing comes from tv or social media. Your conditioning most definitely includes the programing that happened in your actual life. If you aren’t so sure about what I mean by programing, let me explain myself. I mean it’s what you have assimilated throughout all of your life, whether through direct or indirect experiences that left an emotional charge in the body. Direct experiences are the ones you were involved in. They’re the ones where you might have felt small & unworthy or grand & great. They’re the ones that have left a pleasant or unpleasant taste in your mouth or caused your heart to flutter or shatter. They’re the ones that left you speechless and out of breath. They’re the ones you hold on to depict your life story. They’re the ones that are so much a part of you, you might as well make it one of your body parts. You absolutely cannot live without this identification because really who are you without that story of your bleak and dark childhood? Who are you without that tragedy? Ah yes, that’s right. You are everything. You are all. You are the creator of your reality. But that’s not what you’ve been taught because of your programming and conditioning. The indirect experiences are experiences others might have shared with you or things you might have watched that stimulated emotions in you in some way or another.

If you want to move away from tragedy & misery & finally step into creator mode, you’re going to have to figure out what thoughts you’re entertaining. This isn’t an easy task because you have about 60-80 thousand thoughts a day. Of those, 80% are negative thoughts, and 95% are repetitive thoughts. This means what you thought of today, you thought of yesterday and perhaps even last year. This means that in terms of allowing new creative juices to flow into your life, you’re squeezing a juiceless lemon. How can your future be any different to what your present is now if the stream of thoughts coming through are the same?

It isn’t that straightforward to figure out what movie & storyline is playing in your mind. It isn’t straightforward to release the blockages from the body and to let universal energy flow through it. It isn’t always obvious that you are just reliving the patterns of your parents, and their parents before them. However, it is important to start redirecting your focus on what it is you want to see grow & what it is you want to break free from.

These scenes are not superficially sitting in my mind. In fact, they are quite deeply rooted in my subconscious. I know this to be true because these scenes don’t appear right away. It’s not like I think about these things all day long and they most definitely don’t come to my mind immediately. These meditative states I get in are deep states. They’re after I spent a good 15-20 mins meditating. These scenes appear right before I completely zone out. These scenes changed my eating and sleeping habits.

This realization scared me a little. Not because they’re scary scenes but because it really hit me how deeply buried our programming is. What we watch, what we consume daily is ALWAYS being registered at the back of your mind. You may or may not think that this is a big deal but it is. It is because we are glued to all types of screens.

From TikTok to Instagram to Facebook to twitter, millions of photos/videos are being uploaded daily of everything & anything. Our brain is like a sponge & we are very easily influenceable.

We are easily influenceable because for the 45 mins or so of me watching Lorelai & Luke break up and get back together again for the millionth time my senses are stimulated. My eyes are on the screen, my ears are tuned into what they are saying, my taste buds are stimulated because I’m eating my cookie, and I’m emotionally involved in their relationship. I’ve seen their relationship blossom and fall apart & I’m connected to these characters. I’m transported. I would think that’s why most of us watch tv. To be transported to another world. To relax our minds a little. To unwind. To not have to think about anything work or life related. To escape.

& I really see how this can be a big issue for us if we are over consuming media. Because if a tv show like GG can end up in my subconscious mind, I wonder what else is in there. I wonder what else was passively passed on to me without my awareness, without my consent? It is scary to think about because this means we are not thinking for ourselves anymore & if you were to observe your thoughts for 10 mins in silence, without distractions, you would know that to be true. You would know that the voices you hear in your mind are not really yours. You would realise that some of the stories you tell yourself are not based on actual experiences but your own interpretation of what is real and what is not. If we are all programmed by what we’ve consumed and are consuming, we would have lost all our originality.

22. Be of service every single day to yourself and to others. My mantra these last few months has been: show me what you will have me do. I am in service of you, God, Source. I am receptive and I allow you to work through me
23. Everything is a blessing. Trust the process, the journey. Trust the lack of clarity for more clarity
24. You owe it to yourself to believe in yourself, to accept yourself, to walk your path. Be your own best friend, support system, mother, father, guide, teacher
25. Keep your heart open no matter what. Express your true feelings, even if it’s hard
26. Forgive everyone for everything. Forgive yourself. Forgive those that have asked for forgiveness and forgive those that haven’t
27. Know beyond any unreasonable doubt that you don’t know. Accepting that you don’t know gives you space to learn more. Never stay stuck in your beliefs, in your thoughts! That will only create rigidity and inflexibility! 
28. Nobody steals your power. You give it away when you seek acceptance but don’t receive it. You give it away when you expect an outcome and don’t get it. You decide to reclaim your own power. When you do, you will become unstoppable because you’re no longer waiting on others to approve of what you’re doing anymore, you just do what feels intuitively good for you

Pay attention to how you do the little things: the laundry, the dishes, the bed, your skincare routine, … These are done daily and it’s important to find joy in them. Otherwise, you’ll be spending most of your time wishing you were some place else!

Release and let go of anything or anyone that doesn’t spark joy. Especially material things but this also means relationships, food, tv shows, alcohol,… The reason I mention food is because sometimes we enjoy eating certain foods that may cause an upset stomach, headache or physical pains. That isn’t joyful. In fact, it deprives you of feeling good so even though the food item tastes good, if it doesn’t make you feel good after, might be good to consider reducing the amount!

The voice in my head is not me. Oh this is a big, transformational one indeed. The thoughts in my mind are not me, neither are the stories playing. What a relief!

Answers are found in the silence when the mind is quiet

Everyone goes through pain and challenges. Suffering is optional and I’ve come to learn it’s a choice we make. It occurs when one chooses to stay in the same story without taking responsibility for their own happiness

Life and death are closer to each other than I’d like sometimes. My birthday falls on May 4th and my aunt passed away on the 5th. She left exactly 10 years ago today, a day after my 18th birthday, teaching me that both life and death are part of the same cycle

I can be who I want to be at any moment. I get to decide how I want to experience certain things & I can always begin again

Don’t be so hard on yourself. Most likely you just didn’t know better at the time. You did the best you could at the time with what you knew and what you experienced

Nothing will kill your soul faster than forcing yourself to fit in when all the soul craves is to be free & boundless

Take risks. Take leaps of faith throughout your life. You will most likely be pleasantly surprised

Don’t stay mad for too long. Not at yourself, nor your friends or family or even strangers! And if you do get upset: COMMUNICATE! Share with the other why it is you’re upset or angry in a calm, non-aggressive way. Don’t ever repress your anger thinking it’s bad. It’s just showing you that you can take another way, that you have another choice!

Instead of being emotionally reactive, catch that second before you spiral out of control to mitigate the damages. There’s this split second where you can shift the whole experience by not reacting the way you are used to. Instead you choose to be present and to send light to the situation!

Everyone wants to be loved & cared for. No exceptions here. Everyone means everyone. (so love everyone, even if they’ve done you wrong)

No one is paying attention to me the way I am. Most likely, I’m my worst judger and critique!

The universe doesn’t experience itself without me. How cool is that! I get to be a part of this wonderful tapestry and experience the whole universe within this small body of mine!

Like yoga, getting better at cooking took time and personally, I was never really into it until I did my health coaching course. So when I say that this banana bread/cake recipe is simple, I mean it. If I can do this, you can too. The best part of this is, almost anyone can indulge in this because it’s gluten-free, vegan and refined sugar free. It still tastes so good and definitely worth trying it at home, especially during quarantine.

Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups of gluten free flour blend or other non gf option. I use the Bob’s Red Mill Baking Flour 
- 1/2 cup of almond flour (or you can blend almonds after soaking them up and removing the skin). I sometimes like to mix the gf flour with the almond flour together 
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 — 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt (I use Himalayan salt) 
- almost a cup of coconut sugar (xylitol is also a good option for sugar replacement, you can use honey too if you wish) 
- 1/3 cup coconut oil 
- 2 very ripe bananas (the riper the better)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract 
- 1/2 cup of nut milk of choice ( I use almond milk) note that you may need to add a bit more milk if the texture is too thick)
- Optional: add chocolate chips, seeds, fruits, dates, … 

Steps:
1) Start by pre—heating the oven at 180 celsius/350 F
2) Start by having 2 bowls: one for the wet ingredients, the second for the dry ingredients
3) In the first bowl:
- Mash the 2 bananas with a fork
- Mix the coconut oil (if the coconut oil is hard, I usually melt it for 10-15secs in the microwave to have a more liquid texture)
- add the coconut sugar (I don’t like to put too much of it because the bananas are already really sweet)
- Add vanilla extract 
- Add almond milk 
- I recommend mixing in between each step to make sure the consistency is good 

4) In the second bowl:
- Add the flours 
- Add the baking soda and baking powder 
- Add the salt 

5) Combine the first and second bowl together and mix well. You’re looking for a soft consistency but one that is still sticky, not overly liquid or hard (if you find that there’s too much flour, add a bit of almond milk)
6) Optional: Add chocolate chips
7) Pour the mixture into a baking tray. You can add a parchment paper so it doesn’t stick. Sometimes I’ll add a bit of coconut oil into the tray if I don’t add the paper
8) Put it in the oven from 40-45 mins. I usually like to check on it after 20 mins to make sure it’s going well and then again at the 40th min to see that it’s doing okay. Depending on what you prefer, you can choose to cook it for longer if you prefer a harder consistency

What I hope you got from part 1 is that overworking does not equal being productive and successful unless perhaps there’s love. And I would also add that besides love in the equation, there should also be a holistic approach to one’s wealth (which in my language is equal to wellness plus health).
The truth is I’m not the only one who thinks this because companies themselves are moving towards better working hours and providing more benefits to their employees. When your employees are tired, they either get sick or they get sick and tired of your bullshit work that they quit. I may sound harsh but it’s true. The illness I’m talking about isn’t always represented in the way society views illness as realness. We don’t pay enough attention to people’s mental health, emotional health and energetic health.  We expect women to take 3 months of maternity leave and we think that that’s okay. We have women with so many miscarriages and not enough “time” to recuperate from the loss that just happened. We only think that there’s one aspect of health and that is physical health. If you can crawl to work with a cold, then crawl your way through because you and your role are easily replaceable and if you don’t do the work someone else will. That’s what you’ve been told at least.

However even the physical part we can’t nurture properly. We have found so many ways of disrespecting our bodies. We continue pushing, we continue forcing and pursuing instead of actually just being. We find new ways of addiction and countless ways of justifying our addictions. I’m not talking about drug and alcohol addictions only, I’m talking food addiction, caffeine addiction, Netflix addiction, clothes addictions, the unforgiving nature is an addiction, the unforgetting nature is an addiction, your stories are your addictions, who you claim yourself to be is also an addiction. Because if suddenly all those things were taken away, would you be able to know who you are? Would you finally see the divinity that’s always been there to begin? Things fall apart, you fall apart, so you can finally recognize what has always been there and what will always be there: loving awareness, God, source, the universe.

I didn’t get to where I am today if it wasn’t for the experience I myself had working a corporate job.  I’m lucky enough and incredibly grateful to have experienced this type of job, on a much less intense scale. I know for a fact that it wasn’t so bad compared to so many others who have suffered greatly. There are many roles in countless firms that have pushed their employees to burnout. We all know what happens when the internal fire is either completely out or out of control. People get sick, people are misaligned, people are not feeling their best. This out of balance lifestyle impacts communities. When people don’t feel their best, when they are not at their best, performing at their best, there’s a lot of lethargy floating around in the air. This type of emotion is heavy and whether you believe it to be true or not, many people are either lethargic or angry or jealous. And it’s not that those feelings are bad per say, it’s when we don’t look at these feelings and we suppress them for a long time that they can damage a person’s health and the health of society overall.

I also want to add that I don’t believe that there shouldn’t be any lethargy or anger or jealousy in the world, ever. I’m simply saying that we cannot have a big majority of the world not following their dreams because of preconditioned notions. We can’t have people working jobs they hate if we can’t teach them how to tolerate their jobs and shift their perspectives. We have an outdated education system and a belief that life has to be so damn difficult. I’m not saying to be lazy and to not have intentions or to not have dreams. In fact, I’m asking you to do the opposite. I’m asking you to see everything as your responsibility and what I mean by responsibility is this: be responsible for your life. Take ownership of it. Be a decision maker. Integrate yourself to life fully. Be as engaged with people as you possibly can. Give your attention, your awareness to what is at hand, what is at task. If it’s a job you don’t love but really you don’t see a way out, and that can happen, you have to learn how to shift your perspective until the fog clears up and you can finally walk that road again with more clarity than before.

I remember working at my corporate job so clearly. I would wake up at 7am, get on my yoga mat for an hour before heading to work. In the office by 8:45-9am, I would have to sit at my desk until 6,7,8, sometimes 11. I’m not going to exaggerate and say that I stayed passed 7:30 so many times. I did not. Not because I didn’t have to but because I didn’t want to. I wanted to go to that yoga class, spend time with my family and friends, unwind. Unwind from the fact that I sat down on a chair in front of 3 screens for hours, sometimes without speaking to anyone throughout my day.

Work emails always had to be answered. Lunch was mostly at my desk. I remember trying to sneak out sometimes to get food because I knew the workload was heavy and I would be told to have someone grab food for me. I didn’t understand the concept of having to immediately answer all emails, at any time of the day, and on weekends or holidays. I didn’t understand how I could not take a 1-hour break for lunch. I did not get why I had to bring my work laptop with me on vacation and do work. It was torture to have to conform to all those rules and regulations. From the very beginning, I could not picture myself in the shoes of my bosses. The sacrifices I was going to have to make for that job were too grand for me. I did not want to give up my life for a job, especially if I was not even in love with it in the first place.  However, I did not have anything to leave this job for. Yoga was still a hobby and I did not know of any other possibilities. And this was a good thing because it taught me to engage in my work more because I knew that resisting what was happening was only going to enhance my suffering. So, I participated and conformed to the rules, to these obligations for a little while, while I let my passions nest.

Now I know I’m not the only one who went through this. Some of you still are working that kind of job, and I respect you so much for it. I just couldn’t do it anymore. If I’m being honest, I wasn’t “doing it” properly even when I had the job. Not fully at least. Not full heartedly.  I didn’t understand what all the fuss was about, truly I didn’t. I got angry when I missed my 7.30 Wednesday yoga class. I was sad when it was Friday night and I didn’t see the light of day, or didn’t breathe in any fresh air. I would get “déjà vu” moments because everything became so repetitive, so mundane. I was getting flashbacks of the same moment, happening over and over again.

As I was getting more into my yoga journey, I had several epiphanies where I realized it was all a choice. It was my choice to be there. It was my choice to stay there. When I shifted my perspective from “I have to do this” to “I chose to do this”, moments that felt suffocating and frustrating, suddenly started to feel peaceful. I did not care so much that I was in the office at 7.30pm on a Friday evening. It was my choice. When we see our circumstances as a choice and not an obligation, we suddenly feel a weight lift off our shoulders. We are not forced to do anything in life. I had the choice to leave that type of work environment and to pave my own way. I had seen it done before by those I looked up to and if others could do it, I knew I could to. It is also important for me to note that I am privileged in a lot of ways. I’ve had continuous support from my parents and I wouldn’t have been able to do all this if it wasn’t for them and I never want to take that for granted.

Why are work hours so rigid? Does it work for everyone to work a “9-5+” job? I put “9-5” in quotations because depending on where you live, or where you work, your work hours are going to vary greatly. What’s also going to vary greatly are your paid holidays. In the US, you get 2 working weeks off.

Manifestation should become a game for us all to play and to explore. Manifesting our lives, our dreams should be taught because we all have unimaginable power and we should allow ourselves to discover it as best we can. But to manifest what is not meant to be ours will be difficult. This is why while we are alive, while we are here, we might as well do work that is meaningful to us, that sets our hearts on fire. When we pursue something we love and we overwork some days and we balance that out the next day by taking some time to ourselves before getting back into work all day and all night then that’s different. While working on your purpose it doesn’t feel like work. It feels like fun. It feels like excitement. It feels like you just cannot wait to wake up and do this again in the morning.

All great beings, all great successful beings, like Kobe Bryant God bless his soul, all of them pursued their passion. All of them made their purpose fun. Their passion became their life and these types of people don’t only have passion for their careers but their families and for living joyful lives. They overwork yes, they go above and beyond yes, they wake up early, go to sleep late, yes. But they’re doing all these things with love for love and that’s why they become inspirational and motivational. That’s why some of them are big stars. I’m not just talking about big celebrity stars but human stars that have impacted our lives so greatly we wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for them. Some are such big lights in the world that everything they touch in life, they touch it with love.

When you have love missing from the equation then overworking becomes dangerous and creates disturbances in the body and mind. The soul though is always at peace because that’s its essence. The rest of your being however is disturbed by this out of balance equation and is desperately trying to find its way back. And the way back is a journey of its own.

So you see, it doesn’t really matter which path you pick, but how you choose to walk the path that matters. And if you could pick a path, or create your own, because you can, wouldn’t you want to pick the best path for yourself? Wouldn’t you want to explore what it is you came here to explore? It is you wanting what’s best for yourself by yourself that will propel you forward. Dream the best dream dear. Dream the best dream.

Are you planning a trip to Amsterdam and you have no idea where to go, what to eat, and what to expect?
I’ve been to Amsterdam once before around 5 years ago and at the time, I ate everything and anything. I also didn’t get to do much as the weather was incredibly cold and my friends were night owls which meant they partied all night and slept in till 1pm. However this time around I got to explore not only the city and its beautiful roads and museums but the vegan food scene too. This list includes a lot of plant based and gluten free friendly restaurants which will perhaps come in handy if you have the munchies. :)
I was there for only 2 nights and 2 days so I didn’t get to go to all these restaurants and visit all these different places but thought I’d share them nonetheless. For those of you who aren’t plant based or gluten-free this list also includes restaurants for you!

Restaurants & Bars in Amsterdam:

1. Mastino
All vegan and gluten-free pizza! I loved this place so much I wish they would open this in London! It was good pizza, fresh ingredients, cute place, and they had the option to have dairy for those of you who love their cheese!
Definitely recommend this place for non-vegan lovers too!
You can tell by my face I was really enjoying my food here.

2. Beter & Leuk
I love finding places where the locals go to eat instead of the regular touristic places. I really loved this place for brunch. Their pancakes were vegan and gluten free. They had non vegan options too such as this baked egg and cheese dish. On my end I ordered their breakfast mango and pitaya bowl and shared the buckwheat pancakes. Highly recommend this place!

3. Vegan junk food bar
I personally found this place to be very cool. For those who are both vegan and gluten-free, the menu is a lot smaller, and seems less exciting. For vegans only, this place will probably be your favorite! I had the flashy kapsalon as well as these chickpea truffle fries. YUM! (super heavy though)

4. Mr Stacks Tea & Pancakes
In my opinion, this is the best combination: tea and pancakes. Pancakes are my favorite guilty pleasures, especially on a Sunday and this place did not disappoint.
I got the banana pancakes and I did not want the experience of eating it to end.
If you’re a pancake lover, check this place out for sure! It’s all vegan pancakes but if I’m not mistaken they have a chicken pancake option and they have gluten and non gluten free options

5. Momo
This would probably be the Zuma or Nobu of Holland. The music was cool, the setting was very nice. It was recommended to me by several people so I went to check it out. Maybe because I don’t eat their specials, I thought the food was decent. I mainly ordered vegetables and rice so wasn’t so exciting.

6. Conservatorium Hotel
I checked this hotel out and the design inside was so beautiful. I wish I stayed there for lunch or dinner or even to stay the night. From what I heard, they have the best bitterballen croquettes (which I don’t eat of course but you might!)

7. Mook Pancakes
We went there thinking they had gluten-free pancakes but they didn’t. They did however have vegan and non vegan options and their pancakes looked amazing. We had to leave though as they had no gf options.

8. Sla
If you’re looking for a salad and a healthy plant-based restaurant. Most dishes can be made gluten free!

9. Foodhallen
I went to this food court, which is the biggest one in Holland, the first time I went there 5 years ago. It’s food heaven for those that can eat everything and anything. As I didn’t go this time, I can’t tell you for sure how good the food is but last time I went I absolutely loved it. Also, it seems from reviews and several websites that they have gluten free and vegan options but don’t take my word for it.

10. Coffee & Coconuts for breakfast
Didn’t get to go but seems to be a beautiful space from what I saw online. They had a very limited amount of options for gf and vegan but if you’re looking perhaps for coffee and juices only, this place could be it!

11. Breakers Beach House
From photos, the places look stunning! If I had more time, this would have been next on my list. It has great reviews and is mostly a seafood restaurant but their website shows they have gluten-free, vegan options.

12. D’Antica
Italian restaurant that is meant to be the best Italian in the city. From what I gather, famous people have dined there. Have absolutely no idea about their vegan and gluten free menu unfortunately.

13. Izakaya
Japanese Restaurant with South American influences. Seems to be another Nobu/Zuma type restaurant. I had a booking there for Friday night but then opted to eat pizza instead. It has good reviews and seems to be on the more expensive side.

14. The Oyster club
Oysters are a hit and miss for me. I didn’t check this out because I’m not currently into them. Maybe next time I’m there I’ll want to check this place out.

15. Visaandeschelde
Another fish restaurant with good reviews online.

16. Lion Noir
A French/European restaurant with excellent reviews online. The interior design looks so beautiful and it’s meant to be on the more “glamorous” end. It seems to be a good cocktail bar too if you choose not to have dinner there.

17. Mr Porter & Tales of Spirits
There were the 2 bars I got recommended. I don’t really drink so I didn’t check them out. I tend to like to sleep earlier so I can wake up and explore during the day. I just wanted to share these 2 in case you may be different to me and you’re more of a late night kind of person. From what I gathered, Tales of Spirits is one of the best/most beautiful bars in Amsterdam. Some reviews agree with this statement, some don’t but seems to me it’s worth checking this place out.

18. MaMa Kelly
since we now live in the Instagram era, places like MaMa Kelly are a popular place for Instagram photo opps. I did not go as I checked the menu and there weren’t many vegan, gluten free options. On top of that, the reviews were okay-ish. It does look super pretty and pink though for those that are looking for their next Instagram photo!

19. Dignita
An all-day brunch restaurant with 2 locations in Amsterdam. I did not get to go there and from the menu it seems that there were a couple of vegan/gf options.

20. Staring & Jacob
This was recommended to me by a friend and I did not get the chance to go there. It also doesn’t have many plant-based, gluten-free options except for the mighty vegan brunch dish so I did not want to risk it.

21. Eat a cookie at Van Stapele koekmakerij
Doesn’t seem these are gluten free or vegan but apparently worth it since I received several people messaging me about this!

22. Winkel 43
Supposedly the best apple pie :)

Places to see and things to do:
1. Visit canals
I guess this one is a no-brainer? There are canals on every street almost so even if you’re not looking to see them, you will. Although they can look similar, each one does have its own charm. However I didn’t find my favorite canal there so I can’t recommend a specific one. This blogger I follow mentions the Bloemgracht being her favorite one.
2. Moco Museum
Funny enough on this trip, I discovered that I love museums. The Moco in particular is a modern museum and it has a range of different contemporary artists such as Banksy, Yayoi Kusama, Andy Warhol ,… It also had this really cool art installation right at the exit of the museum. It was so cold that day but I took off my coat thinking I would get to sit on the couch and take a photo. Instead the couch was all wet so I had to stand up instead.
3. Van Gogh Museum
I went to this museum 5 years ago and I remembered absolutely nothing. (I think you can put 2 and 2 together on this one). Anyway, this time around I was truly amazed at the story of this artist. I knew he cut his ear off, but didn’t realise it was because he got into a fight with his flatmate that ended up leaving the house. I also didn’t know that he was someone that struggled so much with his mental health that he ended up committing suicide at the young age of 37 years old. What also really hit me was how he had worked so hard all his life, creating over 2,000 artworks and only got recognised for his creativity and paintings only after he passed away. It shows you that sometimes the rewards can come after you pass away and that recognition will not always happen in the way you imagine it.
4. “The Nine Streets” also known as “Negen Straatjes”
These are 3 streets that intersect with 3 canals which is where the number 9 comes from. This is the go-to area for shopping at local Dutch stores. They offer both vintage and designer boutiques and have cute cozy cafes to grab lunch.
5. The Joordan area

Trees and flowers have been blooming again. Weather is getting warmer. The smell of spring is here. It’s my favorite season for sure and I love being outdoors. Unfortunately though, an outing to the park or spending too much outdoors will not rejuvenate me.
I’m one of 10 million people in the UK that will suffer from hay fever and allergies. According to one website, this number will increase to 30 million within the next 20 years. This increase is related to the increase of pollution from traffic and industry. However, it is also highly related to people’s gut health and lower immune systems.

If you’re looking to change your approach to treating seasonal allergies, let’s start with the gut. As you might know by now, I’m all about healing the gut and understanding how the human microbiome can make you more resilient to not only fighting allergies and hay fever, but more serious illnesses too.

If you’re struggling with year long allergies or just doing the spring time, it might be due to high histamine levels. When histamine levels are high, it means there’s a build up of histamine in the body. Histamine intolerance occurs when there is a dysfunction or defiency of the enzymes that break down histamine. In the post below, I  explore what histamine is, the symptoms, the foods to avoid and the foods to eat more of. I share a few supplements that might help you feel better as well.

What is histamine?
Histamines are the chemicals your immune system makes during an allergic response. These chemicals will cause you to sneeze, tear up, or itch. The triggers are pollen, dust, pet hair, grass,… These things aren’t particularly harmful to you but your immune system looks at them as invaders and starts fighting them off, causing you to feel sick and fatigued. It starts triggering inflammation in the body that can become chronic.

The symptoms of a histamine intolerance are numerous:
· unexplained anxiety or exhaustion
· brain fog, headaches, migraines, dizziness
· digestive problems (diarrhea, chronic constipation, stomach cramps or pain, nausea or vomiting, gas or bloating)
· congested, runny, or itchy nose
· red, itchy, or watery eyes
· sneezing
· shortness of breath
· eczema, itchy skin, hives or red bumps
· irregular or increased heart rate
· severe menstrual pain

What foods are high in histamine?
Almost all foods will contain a certain level of histamine but there are some that contain higher levels such as:
·  alcohol (especially wine)
·  bone broth
·  caffeinated drinks
·  aged cheeses (most cheeses)
·  fermented foods (kefir, kimchi, yogurt, sauerkraut)
·  smoked meat products (sausages, ham, bacon, salami)
·  legumes (chickpeas, soybeans, lentils, peanuts)
·  shellfish
·  vinegar
·  sugar
·  fruits such as pineapple, bananas, strawberries, cherries, citrus fruits, avocados
·  vegetables such as tomatoes, eggplants, mushrooms
·  cocoa and chocolate

What foods are low in histamine:
·  fruits such as berries (except those mentioned above)
·  coconut or rice milk
·  herbal teas (except caffeinated teas like black, green, matcha)
·  most leafy greens (except spinach)
·  most vegetables (except tomatoes and eggplants)
·  animal products (organic, fresh, grass fed, not corn fed,…)
·  gluten-free grains

Supplements to help you:
·  vitamin B-1, B6 or B-12, vitamin c
·  copper
·  magnesium
·  zinc
·  calcium
·  folic acid
·  You might want to add turmeric as well as it has antihistamine properties
·  Probiotics – it might be good to check if you have candida or bacterial overgrowth before taking probiotics

Foods that include these vitamins:
Vitamin B6: chicken, turkey, potatoes
Copper: asparagus
Vit C: fruits and veggies

How to test for it:
1.   Try an elimination diet and see how you feel when you remove high histamine foods and vice versa. To test whether it’s something that really makes you feel sick or not, keep the food items out for about 2 weeks and then include them again. If your symptoms reappear you Keep a food journal to help you figure it out!
2.   Find out with a test. You can do a blood test to look for a high histamine/DAO ratio. If this comes up high, it means you don’t have enough enzymes to break them down

A few years into my practice, I decided to do my 200hr Yoga Teacher Training. At first it wasn’t because I wanted to teach others (I actually completely forgot that that’s what the training was for), but because I was passionate about learning more about this practice that changed the course of my life.

I did my training over the course of a year with YogaLondon so that I could continue working my corporate job. It was one of the best, most challenging periods of my life. I was inspired by what I was learning but never did I think to myself “Oh you’re going to love teaching yoga”. I was just doing it to improve my own personal practice and knowledge. The time came when I had to teach the whole class and for the weeks before it, I was so anxious. Me? Teaching 20 people? I hated being in the spotlight nor did I like the sound of my own voice. How was I going to teach others if I didn’t like speaking up loudly in front of a group of people?

I made sure to meditate that morning and I told myself to just do my best. I got to class my heart was beating faster than usual and I felt nervous. However the second I stepped on the mat and we set our intentions I realised that my voice was just a guide. Nobody was looking at me because they’re all in their own practice following their breath and moving to the sound of it. Suddenly I was no longer nervous and I started walking around the room and adjusting some of the students. It was one of those moments where I also felt at one with everyone and everything. I didn’t feel separate from anyone and I felt whole. I knew then and there that teaching would have to be a part of my life. I loved it too much and it felt completely natural to me. I wasn’t faking it, I wasn’t trying too hard to get it right.

I haven’t been teaching much yoga if I’m being honest. I’ve taught a few workshops here and there but I haven’t actually taught as much as I’d like to. There are logistical reasons to it and I wish I could do it more but I am hoping to do more of it this year and to spread my love for yoga with everyone.

I thought it would be fitting to start my first blog post with a little introduction about myself and the beginning of my yoga journey.

To start off, I was born to an American Korean mother and a Lebanese father. My parents met in San Francisco when they were studying there and that’s how I came into this world. Born in Paris on May 4th, 1992, my family and I moved to Kuwait when I was under 1 year old. I grew up there for 18 years and attended the French school which is how I speak English, French and a little bit of Arabic. Anyone who meets me will say I have an accent in every single language I speak which I used to not like about myself but now I think it’s actually cool because nobody can guess where I’m from. I can’t remember the number of times people asked me if I’m Spanish, Latino or Hispanic. I was once even stopped on the road in NYC by someone asking me for directions in Spanish. I looked confused at the person and said I didn’t speak any Spanish. They started shouting at me as though I was denying my roots… I guess also having the name Maria doesn’t help my case. Oh well.

Once I graduated high school, I decided to pursue my studies in San Diego to study Finance and Political Science. It was the best 4 years of my life. I was so lucky to have made long lasting friendships and it was only in my final few weeks of school that I discovered yoga. It was through my personal trainer at the gym that I decided to go to my first class. It was love at first try. I couldn’t believe I had waited that long to try yoga because of how good I felt when I left the class. This feeling of lightness as though I was floating on a cloud. I was hooked from the very beginning and it’s definitely thanks to the teacher who taught me (Elyssa aka @lionandswan on Instagram).

Rewinding back to my earlier years, I remember the first time I heard the word yoga. I was not older than 8 years, sitting in the backseat of our old white Range Rover going into the basement of our building. My mom was driving and said she just came back from a yoga class. I asked her what it was and she answered it was some sort of physical exercise with breathing. I didn’t think much of it. My 2nd encounter with yoga was when I was 12 years old. I would pretend to “do yoga” at the bowling alley. I remember it so clearly, I would roll the ball and immediately sit down with my legs in lotus and start saying “come on strike strike strike”. A lot of the times the ball would actually move from falling into the gutter and magically move to the center and I would knock down all the pins. My friends around me would all laugh hysterically because it was hilarious to witness. Going back to that time, I still don’t know how I knew how sitting in lotus repeating affirmative mantras was yoga but I did. Fast forward 10 years later, I finally find myself in an actual yoga class.

Dimmed lights, sitting at the back of the class, I didn’t know what to expect. I surely didn’t think that this class was about to change my whole life. I just wanted to support my PT who became a really good friend of mine. The tone of her voice was gentle, the energy in the room was calm and centered. It is one of those pivotal moments in your life where you realize that you just discovered something you’ve been craving your whole life: stillness, and mental peace. For years, I struggled with an overly active monkey brain. For years, anxiety was something I thought would never go away. For years, I just believed that my thoughts were me. I was so hooked on yoga that throughout summer I was practicing here and there. I wanted to feel that feeling over and over again. I didn’t know much of the philosophy of yoga or how it could be so therapeutic but that feeling after you come out of savasana and your eyes are wide open like you’re seeing the world for the first time again. No attachments to your past, no worries about your future. Just being present. That same summer I went to a bookstore and bought myself books like The Power of Now, The Secret and another one about changing your thoughts. (Sorry I can’t remember the name!) Slowly but surely, my life was finally making sense to me.

Yoga could not have come at a better time. I was transitioning from being a student to a full time employee in an Asset management company. My first real job. All my life I thought that this would be my path: school, university, job, and then marriage and kids. And that’s what I was planning on doing. At first my job was not very demanding. I was still new and I wasn’t given much work. As the months went on and I started acquiring more responsibilities, I also was getting more stressed out. So at the end of the day, I would run to a yoga class. I needed to unleash all the accumulated stress from work and being in a big busy city like London. Yoga classes were my haven and they still are.
